# Regular Expression Tutorial: Matching a URL

All high-level programming languages come with built-in methods that can check if a string contains a certain character or any combination of characters. For example, the following JavaScript statement will return true:
    ![Alt text](image.png)
These methods are great; however, you need to know the exact string you are searching for. Is there a way we can do this dynamically? For instance, we would like to search the word "fast" but not "fasting". Let's introduce **regular expression**.

## Summary

A **regular expression** (shortened as **regex**) is a sequance of characters that specifies a match pattern in text. Take the following example of a regular expression, which we'll call "Matching a Url":
    ![Alt text](image-1.png)
